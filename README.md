## Background Study 
Women’s safety is a big concern which has been the most important topic till date. Women
safety matters a lot whether at home, outside the home or working place. Few crimes
against ladies particularly rape cases were terribly dread and fearful. Most of the women
of various ages, till this day are being subjected to violence, domestic abuse, and rape. As
ladies ought to travel late night generally, it’s necessary to remain alert and safe. Although
the government is taking necessary measures for their safety, still there are free safety apps
for women that can help them to stay safe. Most of the females these days carry their
smartphone with them, so it is necessary to have at least one the personal safety apps
installed. Such a security app for ladies will definitely facilitate in a way. This is userfriendly application that can be accessed by anyone who has installed it in their smart
phones. Our intention is to provide you with fastest and simplest way to contact your
nearest help. In this system user needs to save five contact numbers, in case of emergency
on shaking the phone thrice, the system sends SMS on every number fed into the system
with the current location. We frequently encounter bad people set up hidden cameras in the
room of the dress trail of the shopping mall or anywhere. They then use these cameras to
record secret videos of women, which they later exploit to extort money by blackmailing
the women. To get rid of this problem, we have added a feature in our system with the help
of magnetometer and phone camera to determine the location of hidden camera or any
electronic device kept in secret. Women can face such difficult moments like: Even when
there are many people around, the woman can't tell anyone even if she is in danger because
she is afraid that if she tells everyone now, it might hurt her more. In the hope of getting
some relief from this, we included a function in our systems that enables the automatic
generation of an emergency sound when the power button is pressed three times, alerting
everyone within hearing distance. Many of us might be unaware that our country has a few
helplines for security. We have thus entered several helpline numbers for women, children,
and emergency services into our system. For the purpose of dialing such numbers right
away after tapping. All features of our system for both everyday safety and real
emergencies, making it an ultimate tool for all.
